### Game Description

Icarus is a session-based survival game for up to 8 co-op players or solo players, where most gameplay occurs during timed missions. Players accept contracts for missions on a space station orbiting the planet, and drop down to its terrain to attempt the objectives. Once a mission timer is complete, the drop-pod returns to the station. If the player fails to return in time, their workshop items are left on the surface and their progress is lost. 
There is also support for an OpenWorld where without resets.
