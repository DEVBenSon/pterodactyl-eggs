Steam Description :
As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements.

## Recommended server settings

### Minimum RAM

This server requires about 4096M to run with no players on a default map. Although it is recommended to run 6144M by the ARK creators, specific DLC maps will increase this requirement, such as Genesis 2 requiring over 13,440M to start.

### RCON

The server requires a local RCON connection to function. You will see RCON connection refused messages until the server has successfully started and connects to the RCON, which can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. The RCON Port is only required for external RCON connections.
