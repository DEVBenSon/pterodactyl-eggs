## The Front
The Front is a survival open-world crafting shooter. You play the role of a resistance fighter sent back in time to stop the rise of a tyrannical empire.

Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285150/The_Front/

## Server Ports
The Server needs 4 Ports. You can choose every Port you want

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 27015    |
| Beacon | 27016    |
| Query | 27017 |
| ShutDownService | 27018 |

## Updating the Server
Until the devs fix their linux server, you must reinstall the server on every update. Autoupdate is disabled and should NOT activated, because it can break your installation. 

## Hardware
You need a min of 10GB for the Server.

## Special Note
> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT ADD STARTUP FLAGS AFTER THE SERVER PASSWORD FLAG, else you are not longer able to login into your server. The Passwort Flag MUST be everytime the LAST flag


## Server Tags
You can use Server Tags with this Egg. But max is 5

To be used in the variable as follows: `0,1,2,3,4`

Available Server Tags

0 = PVP
1 = PVE
2 = EXP Multiplikator
3 = GatheringRate
4 = KeepInventory
5 = 45d wipe
6 = 15d wipe
7 = 30d wipe
8 = 60d wipe

## Troubleshooting

- I get the error "**Server Connection has expired!**"
    - Allocate and open all ports in your Firewall.
