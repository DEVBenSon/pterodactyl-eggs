# HumanitZ


## [Documentation](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2728330/HZ_SERVER)


HumanitZ is a co-op, isometric, open world survival game in a world ended by the zombie outbreak. As one of the few human survivors, try to last as long as “humanly” possible. The past can’t be changed, but you can make a difference today for the future of humanity. 

## Install notes

The current version of the server software is slightly buggy, and as of this writing has no proper documentation.

They include a `README.txt` file with the server software, that includes a description of most of the variables, but not more than that. This is only obtainable via the SteamCMD tool.

## Installation/System Requirements

Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system

## Server Ports

Ports required to run the server in a table format.
