## Install notes

For CS2 Valve has decided to merge the game and server files. There will not be standalone dedicated server files.<br>

## Installation/System Requirements

|  | Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Processor | minim x86-64-v2 (with popcnt) | --- |
| RAM | 2 GB | --- |
| Storage | 33 GB | --- |

## Server Ports

Ports required to run the server in a table format.

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 27015   |
| Source TV (Optional) | 27020 |

## RCON

RCON is only accessible from external apps, NOT from the game client itself. It's broken in CS2.<br>
If possible always use the Pterodactyl console to use your commands like ``map de_nuke`` or ``mp_restartgame 3``.<br>

## Notes

Further install instructions can be found at the official [Documentation](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike_2/Dedicated_Servers).
