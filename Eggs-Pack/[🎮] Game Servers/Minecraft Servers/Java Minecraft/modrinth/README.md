# Modrinth Generic

## This is a generic egg for Modrinth modpacks

You will need to give it a modpack project ID. The project ID for [Extreme Optimization!](https://modrinth.com/modpack/extreme-optimization!) is `1oIpaoJo` for example.
This can be found on the modpack page in the `Technical information` section in the left sidebar.

You can also optionally specify a version ID. If you do not specify a version ID, the latest version will be used. The version ID for [Extreme Optimization!](https://modrinth.com/modpack/extreme-optimization!) version 1.12.2For2.0 is `SyMW2FDv` for example. This can be found on the modpack page by clicking the version number in the `Versions` section.

The script will automatically setup of Forge, Fabric, or Quilt depending on the modpack.

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |
