# Spigot

A high performance Minecraft server implementation

[Spigot Website](https://www.spigotmc.org/)

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |

## Server Specific

Spigot was hit with a DMCA and now requires that it be built by the user.
