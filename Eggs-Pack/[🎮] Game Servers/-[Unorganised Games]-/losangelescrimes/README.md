# Los Angeles Crimes
This egg makes it easy for you to create a public server in the game [Los Angeles Crimes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MA.LAC&hl=in&gl=US).

I made it because I was confused about how to create a server manually which requires using a vpn and so on... But here such a method is not needed. This egg uses a Linux Server that has been provided by the Game Developer.

## Game Description
Los Angeles Crimes lets you play, create, and discover a variety of immersive worlds created by a global community!

Features:
- Free roam, team death-match, zombie survival, car race & soccer
- Third-person & first-person view
- Active-ragdoll and realistic physics
- LAN support
- PS4 controller support (Bluetooth)

## Minimum Requirement
1024MB Ram and 1024MB Disk is enough to run the server. Better to add ram & disk as this is a public server and dozens of people can join.

## Server Port

> **The LAC server can only run on port 7777. So the server port in the pterodactyl panel that you will use must be 7777.**

| Port | Default |
|---|---|
| Public Server | 7777 |

## To Do
- [ ] Can change version.
