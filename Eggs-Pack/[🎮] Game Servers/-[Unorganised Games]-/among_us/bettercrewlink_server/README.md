# Among Us - BetterCrewLink Server

## From their [Github](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink)

This project implements proximity voice chat in Among Us. Everyone in an Among Us lobby with this program running will be able to communicate over voice in-game, with no third-party programs required. Spatial audio ensures that you can only hear people close to you.

## Server Port

Ports required to run the server in a table format.

| Port    | default (HTTPS enabled) | default (HTTPS disabled) |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Game    | 443    | 9736    |

Default port is 443 if HTTPS is enabled, and 9736 if not. But you can change to any port or domain/ip in the egg
