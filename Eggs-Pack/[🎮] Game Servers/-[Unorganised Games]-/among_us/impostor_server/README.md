# Among Us - Impostor Server

## From their [Github](https://github.com/AeonLucid/Impostor)

Impostor is one of the first Among Us private servers, written in C#.
There are no special features at this moment, the goal is aiming to be as close as possible to the real server, for now. In a later stage, making modifications to game logic by modifying GameData packets can be looked at.
